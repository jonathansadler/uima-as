To build Apache UIMA-AS, run the command

  mvn install

in the uima-as directory containing the pom.xml file. 
This will build all the submodules including the binary distribution package.

If you are building from trunk, you may need to first build the uimaj project in 
.../uima/uimaj/trunk using "mvn install", as UIMA-AS depends on the uimaj project. 

Apache Maven 3.0 or later is required to build this.
